      description2: "    When doing tasks manually, the worker loses time that could be used otherwise for other tasks. The more extensive the services and workforce that your organization has, the more time and resources will be wasted.",
      description3: "    Manual labor is often prone to human errors such as calculation errors and oversight. These errors can lead to quality problems, customer dissatisfaction, and financial losses. Because your processes rely on individual employees' judgment and abilities, they can also result in inconsistent outcomes.\n    Relying on manual processes can require a larger workforce to handle repetitive tasks, increasing labor costs. This can put pressure on the organization's budget and profitability. It can become a bottleneck as an organization grows and lead to delays and service interruptions.\n    Not automating manual processes can hinder an organization's competitiveness, efficiency, and ability to adapt to changing market conditions. It can also lead to higher costs, errors, and missed opportunities, ultimately affecting the organization's overall success and sustainability.",
      description4: "    Automating manual tasks in your organization can lead to increased efficiency, reduced errors, and cost savings.",
      description5: "    Start by identifying which tasks in your organization can be automated. Look for repetitive, rule-based, and time-consuming tasks that are prone to human error. Define clear automation objectives. What are the specific goals you want to achieve? Is it to reduce processing time, improve accuracy, or free up employee time for more valuable tasks? Having a clear understanding of your goals will guide your automation efforts.\n    Work with your automation team or software developers to design automated workflows. These workflows should mimic manual processes, but execute them automatically.\n    Once you are confident in the automation, implement it in your production environment. Make sure your employees are trained to use and monitor automated systems. Regularly review and update the automation to adapt to changes in your organization or technology.",
      description6: "    Ideally, this should be the first pattern you implement in your organization if you decide to transform digitally. Not many of the other patterns can be accomplished without automating the most basic processes.\n    After implementing this pattern, the next step in the implementation aspect is At dawn or Pilot lines. Implementation aspect is crucial for a successful digital transformation. It contains many meta patterns about implementing digital transformation itself.\n    Alternatively, you can try other aspects of digital transformation, such as Structural Modernisation in the management aspect or Data Digitisation in the data aspect. Both are a great entry pattern towards digital transformation."

Implementing digital transformation is an expensive feat, and you have no way of knowing if it will succeed or fail.",
      description2: "    Implementing a large-scale change in an organization can bring about numerous benefits, but it also comes with several downsides and challenges. If the idea is flawed, it could damage or completely stop your productivity.",
      description3: "    Implementing significant changes often requires a substantial investment of time, money, and resources. These costs can strain an organization's budget and divert resources away from other important initiatives.  Large-scale change initiatives are also often complex and can face unexpected obstacles.\n    One of the most significant challenges is the resistance of employees. People often prefer the status quo and can be resistant to changes that disrupt their routines or job roles. If an organization frequently undergoes large-scale changes, employees may experience 'change fatigue', where they become less receptive to subsequent initiatives due to exhaustion from continuous disruptions.\n    Effectively communicating the reasons for the change, the timeline, and the expected outcomes is crucial. Change can create uncertainty and stress among employees. Fear of job loss, increased workloads, or concerns about their ability to adapt can negatively impact morale and well-being, which, in turn, can affect performance.",
      description4: "    Implementing pilot groups is an effective way to test changes in an organization before rolling them out on a larger scale. Pilot groups allow you to identify and address potential issues, gather feedback, and refine your change initiative based on real-world experiences.",
      description5: "    Clearly define the scope of the change that you want to test with the pilot group. Create a detailed plan outlining the pilot's timeline, goals, and responsibilities.\n    Choose a representative sample of employees or teams to participate in the pilot. This group should reflect the diversity of the organization. Consider both including individuals who are enthusiastic about the change and those who may be more resistant to it.\n    Introduce changes to the pilot group according to the plan. Ensure that they have the necessary resources and support to implement the changes effectively. Continuously monitor the progress of the pilot group and collect data on their experiences with the changes. Keep detailed records of the pilot, including what worked well and what did not.\n    Once you have successfully tested the changes with the pilot group and addressed any issues, you can expand the implementation to the broader organization. Ensure that employees throughout the organization receive adequate training and support as the changes are implemented on a larger scale. By implementing pilot groups in this structured manner, organizations can minimize the risks associated with large-scale changes, increase the chances of success, and create a smoother transition for employees.",
      description6: "    Pilot lines are usually used to test out new products. However, the same strategy is applicable to organizational changes. Most people do not adapt well to changes. Pilot lines are a great way to test out your digital transformation changes and ease your employees in. For better integration, you can try Resistance to change. Do not forget to properly train your employees on the new practices using Training montage.",

Storage of physical data can involve having to print out a lot of pages of data and storing them in boxes in a dedicated storage room. Employees can then check out entire boxes of data when looking for any information within them.",
      description2: "    Printed data takes up a lot of space, and unless you have an extremely good search system in place, it is near impossible to find whatever you are looking for in reasonable amount of time. Physical data tends to get lost when someone borrows it. If more employees need the same data, you might not have enough copies.",
      description3: "    The more data your organization produces and needs to store, the more space the hard copies will take. The more space the data takes, the longer it takes to find the required information. Many organizations employ additional people to sort their physical data storage and come up with a system to better organize them. But no matter how great that sorting system is, it will still take extra unnecessary time to find the right data.\n    In a system like this, employees who need data will need to check the data out and then bring it back. However, many people can be careless around company property. It might not happen often, but employees will lose some of your data or forget to return it. With a check out system it is likely that you will find the culprit who lost your data, but then by that time the damage is already done.\n    Another problem that arises from having physical copies of data is that multiple people cannot have the same piece of data. They need to either create more copies of the data which need to be processed or shredded afterward, or they have to wait until the first employee is done with the data.",
      description4: "    You can solve all these problems by digitizing your data. Data digitization is an incredibly important step in digital transformation. It is impossible to go through the digital transformation without digitizing your data.",
      description5: "    Start by creating a team to sort the already physical data and scan all of it. After that select an appropriate digital system to store your data. The most common ones are digital drives and databases. Then your team moves the scanned data to your desired new storage system.\n    Now that you have a storage system, it is important to keep backups of everything. These backups can be digital, but in some cases physical backups may be better. Mistakes happen and if part of your data was accidentally deleted, you can easily recover it from the backups.",
      description6: "    It is important to inform your other employees that you no longer use physical data storage. Also, as with everything new, you need to teach your employees how to use the new system. Fortunately, no matter how large an error user can do in a digital system, it is much easier to notice and fix it in a digital system than in a physical system.\n    If new problems arise with the new storage system, try the next data pattern: Digital storage inadequacy. Once you have digitized your data, it is also important to protect them. Data security does not come naturally to most employees, so it is important to educate them on this matter. Try Security breach for basic data protection.",

Rushing into digital transformation without a plan can result in increased costs, longer timelines, and a loss of focus on core goals.",
      description3: "    Without a clear plan, organizations can end up investing significant financial and human resources into digital transformation initiatives that do not align with their long-term goals or deliver meaningful results. Organizations may struggle to determine whether the resources spent are providing value.\n    A detailed plan typically includes governance structures and guidelines for decision-making. Without these in place, there may be confusion as to who is responsible for various aspects of the transformation, leading to inefficiencies and conflicts.\n    Your organization may try to automate or digitize existing processes in an inefficient or outdated way. This can perpetuate problems rather than solve them. Incomplete planning can lead to difficulties in integrating new digital systems with existing ones. This can result in data silos, inefficiencies, and a lack of interoperability.",
      description4: "    It's crucial for organizations to develop a comprehensive digital transformation strategy that outlines clear goals, timelines, budgets, and a roadmap for implementation. This strategy should also involve stakeholders across the organization to ensure alignment and support throughout the process.",

Prioritize your objectives based on their importance and potential impact on the organization.\n    Create a detailed roadmap that outlines the phases and timeline of your digital transformation journey. Define milestones and key performance indicators to measure your progress. Acknowledge and celebrate milestones and successes along the way to maintain motivation. Learn from failures and setbacks, using them as opportunities for improvement.\n    Continuously monitor the progress of your digital transformation efforts. Regularly review your performance and adjust the strategy as needed to stay on track. Study industry trends and best practices related to digital transformation.

Teams may work alone, leading to misunderstandings, duplication of efforts, or crucial information that does not reach the right people. Tasks may take longer to complete due to unclear lines of authority.\n    Employees may become frustrated when they perceive that the organizational structure is unfair or when they are not provided opportunities for growth and advancement. Employees can receive contradictory directives from different superiors and stall on a project until they receive further clarification. This can result in low morale, high turnover rates, and reduced productivity.\n    Many small organizations can be content with a one team (flat) organizational structure. When expanding, the organization has to rely on the following procedures to streamline communication and improve efficiency. If you are planning to expand you need to set up a more functional structure that includes multiple layers of management.",
      description4: "    Improving your organizational structure is a critical step in enhancing efficiency, productivity, and overall performance. Start by conducting a thorough analysis of your current organizational structure. Identify areas where problems exist, such as communication breakdowns, inefficiencies, or lack of clarity in roles and responsibilities.",
      description5: "    Clarify the roles and responsibilities of each team member or department. Ensure that everyone understands their duties and how they contribute to the organization's objectives. Encourage collaboration and innovation by creating cross-functional teams that bring together individuals from different departments to work on specific projects or initiatives.\n    If your internal structure is too extensive, reducing unnecessary layers of management can streamline decision-making and improve communication. Consider eliminating positions or combining roles where possible. Involve employees in the restructuring process. Receiving their input and feedback can provide valuable insights and make them feel more invested in the changes.",

If you're facing significant challenges or are unsure about the best way to improve your organizational structure, consider consulting with organizational development experts or management consultants for guidance.\n    This pattern takes a great deal of inspiration from how Coplien's patterns manage organizational structure. In his pattern, 4.1.18 : Work flows inward, Coplien describes how the organization structure should be improved so all the roles are clear cut to avoid waste and confusion. Decisions should come from authority roles and work should come from developers, or in our case, workers.\n    Changing the structure of your organization is a huge and necessary step toward digital transformation. This is the first structural pattern in the management aspect of digital transformation. Use Resistance to change if the employees are having trouble adapting to this change.\n    At this point, it may be useful for your organization to get some visibility on the Internet. Use patterns Front page of the organisation or Social media presence to increase your visibility among potential customers.\n    An important aspect of modern digital transformation is remote work. Many organizations cannot have remote work environment. However, if you could implement remote work in your organization we recommend that you do. Use Hybrid work program to start.",

Manual data entry is prone to errors, which can lead to inaccuracies in employee records, payroll calculations, and compliance reporting. These errors can have legal and financial consequences for the organization.\n    Accessing HR-related information can be cumbersome. Employees may struggle to find important documents and HR professionals may have difficulty retrieving specific data when needed. Employees may not have an easy way to view and update personal information, access pay stubs, or request time off.\n    As organizations grow, manual HR processes become increasingly challenging to manage. Organizations that do not embrace HR automation may find it difficult to keep up with competitors who have more efficient HR processes.",
      description4: "    Automating HR processes can significantly improve efficiency, reduce errors, and streamline administrative tasks. Implement an electronic document management system to store and manage employee records securely. Automate data entry for employee information, such as personal details, job history, and certifications, to reduce manual data input.",

Automate exit interview surveys and feedback collection. Set up offboarding checklists and workflows to ensure a smooth transition for departing employees.\n    Implement payroll software that automatically calculates wages, deductions, and taxes. You can also connect payroll software with time and attendance systems to further streamline the process. Provide employees with self-service portals where they can access their pay stubs, benefits information, and update personal details.\n    To successfully automate HR processes, organizations should select appropriate HR software and tools that align with their specific needs. Integration between various HR systems and other departments (for example, payroll finance) is crucial for a seamless experience. In addition, ensure that employees and HR personnel receive proper training on the new automated processes to maximize their benefits.",

To continue further with more advanced automation try Time management automation. Automating processes like these allow for more hands-off approach for many departments. Consider implementing a Hybrid work program if you are able to fully take advantage of automation.\n    By this point, you should have completed Data digitization by digitizing physical data copies.

The problem is how to accomplish it. Implementing a remote work program would require a lot of resources. This transition even destroyed many organizations during the Covid lockdowns.",
      description3: "    Implementing a remote work program in an organization can offer numerous benefits, such as increased flexibility, access to a wider talent pool, and potentially lower overhead costs. However, there are also several challenges and potential problems that organizations can face when implementing remote work programs.\n    The most important problems are solving communication issues, access to technology, monitoring employees' work, and training new employees. These problems can discourage from implementing remote work but are not unsolvable.\n    During Covid lockdowns, many organizations had only a short window of time to adapt to the new remote work programs. Now these programs are explored and well documented. However, as we have seen during the lockdown, an instant large-scale change of the entire work structure can destroy an unprepared organization.",
      description4: "    Start slowly with a hybrid work program. Select only trial employees to work from home whilst the rest continues to work from the office. Alternatively, build a scheduling system for your employees in which they work some days out of the office and some from home. Clearly outline your organization's remote work policy. Specify who is eligible for remote work, under what circumstances, and how often.",
      description5: "    Remote work is not ideal for any organization. Based on your organization's field of work, you may need more or fewer employees in the office. However, in every organization, there are people who could do the same job from home.\n    Addressing the most common problems requires a thoughtful and well-planned remote work program, clear policies and guidelines, ongoing communication, investment in technology, and a commitment to employee well-being. Flexibility and adaptability are key as organizations strive to find the right balance between remote and on-site work to meet their goals and accommodate employee needs.",
      description6: "    Hybrid work programs combine remote and on-site work offering perfect balance between the flexibility of remote work and the structure and social interaction of a traditional office environment. Employees have more flexibility to manage their work schedules around personal commitments, reduce stress, and improve overall well-being.\n    Organizations can recruit from a broader geographic area, as not all employees need to be in commuting distance to the office. Employers can reduce the costs associated with maintaining a full-time office space, such as utilities and rent, especially if they opt for smaller office spaces.\n    Don't forget that employees meeting in person to get to know each other and gain a sense of belonging in the team is crucial to every team. Even if your employees work fully remotely and it would be very difficult for them to come to work, organize an in person team meeting at least once a year. Coplien has discovered a pattern that highlights the benefits of such meeting 5.1.10: Face to face before working remotely. He especially insists on an initial meeting before starting a project. This initial meeting can be important; however, when working in an environment that has an ongoing project or a focus that spans multiple years, as is typical in most departments of an organization, these meetings should be held regularly.\n    The benefit of a hybrid work program is that you can ease into it. If you have trouble with remote work equipment, try \nameref{remoteequipmentshortage}. Use more advanced organizational patterns such as Group outliers and Regrouping to keep in touch with remote employees.",

Digital storage also tends to be slower and less efficient with huge amounts of data.",

When digitizing, these mistakes get multiplied and much more common. These mistakes can make it harder for employees to work with this data afterwards. Also, when multiple teams digitize data, the final result can end up in multiple formats and much of the data will be duplicated.\n    Maybe you have decided to have both a database and a shared digital drive. If these digital storages are not connected in any way, data from one source will be harder to connect to data from the other. This might make accessing and analyzing data for employees more difficult, especially if they need some data from both sources.\n    As the amount of data grows, you need to start worrying about scalability. Over time your digital storage system will get fuller and with that slower. The storage system needs to be maintained and improved over time, otherwise, it will become unusable after some time.",
      description4: "    To address these problems you need to establish a long-term data strategy. A proper data strategy can help you optimize efficiency and usefulness of your data storage system.

Once you have digitized all of your data, it is much easier to develop a strategy and organize your data. Start by understanding what types of data are currently held. Identify where the data comes from and estimate its growth rate.\n    Explore new storage technologies and solutions, including cloud storage, on-premises solutions, and hybrid models. Evaluate existing data storage infrastructure for capacity, performance and reliability. Consider the costs of various storage solutions against the benefits they offer. Account for maintenance, upgrades, and potential scaling costs.\n    If you get the latter issues you should look into investing more into data management tools and different technologies with data integration. These tools as well as people dedicated to improving your data system will be able to solve almost any issue, that you could have with data storage.",

Many people already have their own issues with time management. This problem isn't about personal time management skills, but bad time management skills can greatly amplify this problem.\n    When tasks are not properly distributed or prioritized, employees may become overwhelmed with workloads. Poor task management can result in misallocation of resources, including time and budget. This inefficiency can impact profitability and resource utilization.\n    Without proper task management, projects can suffer scope creep, where additional tasks or changes are introduced without clear documentation or approval. This can lead to project delays and increased costs.\n    Bad task management usually stems from communication problems. These problems need to be dealt with before negative consequences emerge. In the end, it will lead to a variety of problems that can hinder productivity, create inefficiencies, and impact overall performance.",

It is the manager’s job to consider each one and crosscheck them across workdays of the entire team to see whether the request will be approved.\n    Besides, everyone sends in their time in a different format. The manager then needs to organize and unify this information before they get to approving it. Even if these requests were in unified format, they will still be disorganized and in larger team there will be too many to consider. That’s why a tool will be necessary to help manage time between teams.",

When creating your own application, you can design it specifically to your needs.\n    Alternatively, if either financial or human resources are limited, you can adapt an existing application to suit your needs. For smaller teams, maybe even a Google calendar would be adequate. Otherwise, there is a lot of scheduling or time keeping software that you can use. However, when adapting a different application, there might be some features missing, or an abundance of features, you will never need.\n    To switch over to the new system, members of the team will require instructions or schooling on how to use the new application.

It will take less time for employees to request changes in their work time and less time for management to approve them. All requests will be unified and organized, so it will be much easier for the manager to look over and approve them.\n    Ensure that the new time management tool integrates well with other software and systems that your organization uses. This might require technical adjustments or working with vendors for custom solutions.\n    The goal of this pattern is to better utilize management's time. There are some parts of the management process that are easy to automate. Automating them will free up time that management would use to routinely manage their team. This would mean that they can put the freed up time to improve their team and move them forward.\n    Instead of this specific problem, your organization might face a different problem that requires automation via custom software. Feel free to use this pattern to solve all kinds of different problem, time management is just a specific example.\n    Don't forget to keep your software up to date for the latest features. This applies even if it is your own custom software. Go to Routine software maintanance for more information. To move even further in automation, try Customer service automation.

You can always try to automate more internal processes using patterns in the automation aspect like Robot resources or Time management automation. Afterwards, you can move onto the final pattern Evaluation.",

      description1: "...to accomplish your goals easier, you divide your entire workforce into teams. These teams may consist of 8-12 people. Each team helps you achieve your goal by working on a specific task they are assigned with. Once accomplished, they move onto another task or are disbanded.",
      description2: "    Sometimes a team divides internally into smaller groups. These groups have better communication within themselves, but communication across the entire team is missing. The team then lacks coordination, multiple people work the same task, and some tasks are not being worked at all.",
      description3: "    This can mostly happen in larger teams. People don’t just get grouped within teams, sometimes people can get separated entirely from communications. Then they aren't fully informed on what is happening and can do tasks that are obsolete.\n    Every team needs a way to communicate between all members. Face-to-face meetings are nice, but if people are working remotely, they aren't an option. When the members of the team don’t see each other for longer, they can grow apart. That can negatively affect team coordination.\n    Bad coordination can result in missed deadlines, people working on low-priority or obsolete tasks, and chaos within your team. Some actions must be taken to help bring the entire team up to speed.",
      description4: "    It is essential to keep everyone on the team up-to-date on progress toward the main goal. Everyone needs to know precisely what they are supposed to be doing.",
      description5: "    Communication is key. Establish weekly meetings for the entire team, where people can report their progress on their tasks. That way everyone will be up to date with the team progress. Getting everyone from the team on the same call will also improve morale.\n    These meetings do not have to be weekly, but should be regular, so people can get used to them more easily. However, the frequency of these meetings should be at least monthly. The more often they are, the better the clarity of team communication. Still, if they are too frequent, some members might miss some of them, or there will be nothing to report at all.",
      description6: "    At the start of a project these meetings should be more frequent, with occurrence multiple times in a week or even daily. The start of a project is always rapidly changing and fast paced, so it is important to keep all team members up to speed. For more guidance, you can refer to Coplien's pattern 5.2.7: Stand up meeting.\n    This is the final pattern of the management aspect of the digital transformation. After completing this pattern, you can utilize Evaluation to continuously improve your management styles. Don't forget about your remote employees use Group outliers to include them in your meetings.",

      description2: "    Digital maturity doesn't stop here. Technology advances every year and organizations have to continuously adapt to it. Adapting to new technologies is what keeps you in front of your competitors. If you choose to stop digital transformation, you can lose your advantage in today's rapidly changing business landscape.",
      description3: "    Perceived technological obsolescence can negatively impact a company's brand image. Customers expect businesses to provide convenient, seamless, and technologically advanced experiences. Failing to meet these expectations can result in customer dissatisfaction and loss of loyalty.\n    Tech-savvy employees may be less inclined to work for or stay with organizations that do not provide access to the latest tools and technologies. This can make it challenging to attract and retain top talent.\n    Legacy systems may lack the scalability needed to accommodate growth or changes in business requirements. This can limit the organization's ability to expand or adapt to evolving market conditions. New technologies often create opportunities for innovation and growth. Organizations that do not adapt can miss the opportunity to develop new products, enter new markets, or create strategic partnerships.",
      description4: "    Continuously adapting to new technologies is essential for the long-term success and competitiveness of any organization. Create a dedicated team or committee responsible for monitoring technology trends, evaluating their potential impact on the organization, and recommending adoption strategies.",
      description5: "    Develop a technology roadmap that outlines the organization's technology strategy and goals for the short, medium, and long term. This roadmap should align with the overall business strategy. Conduct regular technology assessments to identify gaps and opportunities for improvement. Assess the current state of your technology infrastructure, software, and processes.\n    Implement small-scale pilot projects to test new technologies and assess their suitability for your organization. This allows you to learn from real-world experiences before making large investments.\n    Ensure that your technology infrastructure is scalable and can accommodate growth and evolving needs without significant disruptions. Conduct periodic reviews of your technology strategy and roadmap to ensure that they remain aligned with the evolving needs of the organization and industry trends.",
      description6: "    This would be the last pattern in your journey through digital transformation. Don't forget that adapting to new technologies is an ongoing process, and it requires commitment, flexibility, and a willingness to embrace change throughout the organization.",
